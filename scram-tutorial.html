    <h1>What is Scramjet?</h1>
    <p>Scramjet is a tool that lets your website act like a tiny “middle-man” for web traffic.
       People use it for learning how proxies and service-workers work.</p>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Scramjet files (from the docs).</li>
      <li>Put them in a folder called <code>scram</code>.</li>
      <li>Add a file called <code>sw.js</code> to control it.</li>
      <li>Publish your site.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This page just explains it. It doesn’t do any hacking — it’s for learning how websites
       can load service-worker code.</p>
